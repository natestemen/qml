This is our repository for the [QSciTech-QuantumBC Virtual Workshop 2022](https://www.cmc.ca/qscitech-quantumbc-virtual-workshop-2022/) (Jan 24-Feb 10).

In this project we work with the [banknote authentication data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication) provided by [UCI's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) as well as a [fraud detection bank data set](https://www.kaggle.com/volodymyrgavrysh/fraud-detection-bank-dataset-20k-records-binary). Our goal was to use quantum machine learning to do classification on both of these data sets.

The workshop ended in poster presentations (you can find ours [here](pres.pdf)) and we won 2nd place for the competition and were awarded $75CAD each.
